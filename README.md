- **Fuzzy Matching**: Intelligent file path and code snippet matching (requires `thefuzz` library)

### 🛠️ **Function Calling Tools**
The AI can automatically execute these operations when needed:

#### **File Operations**
- `read_file(file_path: str)` - Read single file content with automatic path normalization
- `read_multiple_files(file_paths: List[str])` - Batch read multiple files efficiently
- `create_file(file_path: str, content: str)` - Create new files or overwrite existing ones
- `create_multiple_files(files: List[Dict])` - Create multiple files in a single operation
- `edit_file(file_path: str, original_snippet: str, new_snippet: str)` - Precise snippet-based file editing

#### **Git Operations** 
- `git_init()` - Initialize a new Git repository
- `git_add(file_paths: List[str])` - Stage files for commit
- `git_commit(message: str)` - Commit staged changes with a message
- `git_create_branch(branch_name: str)` - Create and switch to a new Git branch
- `git_status()` - Show current Git status

### 📁 **File Operations**

#### **Automatic File Reading (Recommended)**
The AI can automatically read files you mention:
```
You> Can you review the main.py file and suggest improvements?
→ AI automatically calls read_file("main.py")

You> Look at src/utils.py and tests/test_utils.py
→ AI automatically calls read_multiple_files(["src/utils.py", "tests/test_utils.py"])
```

#### **Manual Context Addition (Optional)**
For when you want to preload files into conversation context:
- **`/add path/to/file`** - Include single file in conversation context (supports fuzzy matching)
- **`/add path/to/folder`** - Include entire directory (with smart filtering)

**Note**: The `/add` command supports fuzzy matching for file paths, making it more forgiving. The AI can read files you mention in conversation automatically via function calls, with optional fuzzy matching if `thefuzz` is installed.

### 🎨 **Rich Terminal Interface**
- **Color-coded feedback** (green for success, red for errors, yellow for warnings)
- **Model indicators** (💬 for Chat, 🧠 for Reasoner)
- **Git branch display** in prompt when enabled
- **Real-time streaming** with visible reasoning process (Reasoner mode)
- **Structured panels** for function call execution and results
- **Progress indicators** for long operations

### **Enhanced Commands**

#### **Model Management**
- **`/reasoner`** - Toggle between DeepSeek Chat and DeepSeek Reasoner models
- **`/r1`** - One-off call to DeepSeek Reasoner for complex reasoning tasks

#### **Git Workflow**
- **`/git init`** - Initialize Git repository with optional .gitignore creation
- **`/git status`** - Show detailed Git status with file staging information
- **`/git branch <name>`** - Create and switch to new branch
- **`/commit [message]`** - Stage all files and commit (prompts for message if not provided)

#### **Directory & Context Management**
- **`/folder [path]`** - Set base directory for file operations
- **`/folder reset`** - Reset to current working directory
- **`/clear-context`** - Clear conversation history while preserving system prompt
- **`/clear`** - Clear terminal screen

#### **Utility Commands**
- **`/help`** - Show comprehensive command reference
- **`/git-info`** - Display detailed Git capabilities
- **`/exit` or `/quit`** - Exit the application

#### **Fuzzy Matching**
- **`/add`** - Supports fuzzy matching for file paths (install `thefuzz` for best results)

### 🛡️ **Security & Safety**
- **Path normalization** and validation with configurable base directories
- **Directory traversal protection**
- **File size limits** (5MB per file)
- **Binary file detection** and exclusion
- **Smart context management** to prevent token overflow

## Technical Details

### **Models**
- **DeepSeek-Chat**: Fast, efficient model for everyday coding tasks
- **DeepSeek-Reasoner (R1)**: Advanced reasoning model with visible Chain-of-Thought

### **Enhanced Architecture**
- **Smart Context Management**: Automatic file context with size limits and deduplication
- **Git Integration**: Automatic staging, branch tracking, and status monitoring  
- **Conversation History**: Smart truncation preserving tool call sequences
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of API errors and file operation failures

### **Function Call Execution Flow**
1. **User Input** → Natural language request or command
2. **Model Selection** → Chat vs Reasoner based on current mode
3. **AI Processing** → Function calls executed automatically
4. **Real-time Feedback** → Operation status and results displayed
5. **Context Updates** → Conversation and file contexts maintained

## File Operations Comparison

| Method | When to Use | How It Works |
|--------|-------------|--------------|
| **Automatic Reading** | Most cases - just mention files | AI automatically calls `read_file()` when you reference files |
| **`/add` Command** | Preload context, bulk operations | Manually adds files to conversation context upfront |
| **Function Calls** | AI-driven operations | AI decides when to read/write files based on conversation |

**Recommendation**: Use natural conversation - the AI will automatically handle file operations. Use `/add` for bulk context loading.
